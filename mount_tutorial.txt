# to list all available device
lsblk

# to list of all mounted devices
mount
# use with grep command to get filtered results
# you can check mounted devices from lsblk, the last argument in that is displayed is the mount point

# unmount a device
# all the hdd/pendrive/ssd are called devices, They can further have partion inside them
sudo umount /dev/<device_name>


# mount a device
# actually you need to mount the partition
sudo mount /dev/<partition_name> /<location where to be mounter>
# usually it is mounted at "/media" if it is temp
# it is mounted at "/mnt" if it is kinda permanent
# You need to specify the folder as well for mounting, and the folder need to exist
## e.g.
mkdir /media/<user>/<folder where it will be mounter> # here it can be test_mount
mount /dev/sde1 /media/veran/test_mount
# now all your folders in the hdd are at /media/veran/test_mount/<lcoation on disk>
